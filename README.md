# My Project 

## Reflection  
This project helped me understand how to structure a full webpage using HTML and CSS.  
I learned how to apply flexbox for responsive layouts, manage headers, navigation bars, and footers, and design clean card sections.  
Working with SVGs and favicons was another challenge, especially embedding paths directly into code.  
Overall, I improved both my coding skills and confidence in building responsive and well-structured websites.
